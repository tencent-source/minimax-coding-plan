POST BODY:

Hey everyone,

Wanted to share a deal I found for those using AI coding assistants.

**What is it?**
MiniMax has a "Coding Plan" - unlimited API access to their M2.1 model for $2/month (starter tier). It works with basically every AI coding tool:

- Cursor
- Claude Code  
- Cline
- Roo Code
- OpenCode
- Kilo Code
- Trae
- Grok CLI
- Codex CLI
- Droid

**Why it's interesting:**
- Way cheaper than OpenAI/Anthropic API costs
- M2.1 is surprisingly capable for coding tasks
- Works as a drop-in replacement in most tools

**The deal:**
- $2/month starter plan runs until Jan 15, 2026
- Referral program gives 10% off your first payment

If you want to try it: https://tencent-source.github.io/minimax-coding-plan/

That's my referral page - you get 10% off, I get some API credits. Win-win.


Anyone else tried it? Curious what others think of M2.1 for coding.
